### CreateKTX2

`CreateKTX2.py` is a tool for RTGL1 that compresses PNG files from input folder to KTX2 files with
BC7 format to output folder. Folders of the files are preserved the
same as in the input folder.

`CreateKTX2Cache.txt` is created and it contains meta info about compressed textures. If the edit date of some files has been changed, `CreateKTX2` will recreate corresponding KTX2 files, otherwise they'll be untouched.

CreateKTX2 requires `compressonatorcli` to be in the `PATH`:

### GenerateBlueNoiseKTX2

`GenerateBlueNoiseKTX2.cpp` is a C++ snippet that should guide how to generate special KTX2 file that contains multiple layers, each representing a RGBA blue noise texture. There should be a source folder that contains each layer separately in KTX2 format, then `GenerateBlueNoiseKTX2` generates a single KTX2 file.

*Warning: target blue noise texture MUST contain 128 layers and each layer MUST have size of 128x128 pixels.*
